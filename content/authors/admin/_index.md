I am a mathematics undergraduate from Latin America. 

The last 50 years have been the most fruitful ones, despite having existed for
more than 2000 years, for Mathematical Music Theory, the discipline which studies connections between math and music.

In light of that, the goal of this blog is to share some of the ways in which 
those fields of study intersect.
